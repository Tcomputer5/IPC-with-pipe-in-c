# IPC-with-pipe-in-c
Inter Process communication between n processes by using only 2 pipes in c 
# start
  The goal of this project is to understand the real behavior of pipe when communicating with processes.
  it should be mentioned that it's a real challenge if we want to use only 2 pipes because by default for n processes we need 2n pipes.
  so we should consider the parity of a process.
